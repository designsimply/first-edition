First Edition is a WordPress theme made for book authors. Options include customizeable colors, fonts, logo, and footer text. Along the skyline, waves of clouds are looming. Shadows lengthen. You build a fire, gather up a flannel blanket, sip a hot beverage and settle in for an evening of writing in your First Edition blogâ€”where everything from ultimate truths of the universe to tropes of fiction are penned.
